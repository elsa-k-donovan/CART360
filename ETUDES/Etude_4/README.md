# Interface for "And I Made Sure to Hold Your Head Sideways"

We chose to create an interface for the itch.io game "And I Made Sure to Hold Your Head Sideways" by Jenny Jiao Hsia.

The game can be found at this link:
https://q_dork.itch.io/and-i-made-sure-to-hold-your-head-sideways

The game is about taking care of an intoxicated friend.
We chose to create a pillow which one could cradle and comfort as a representation of the actions taking place in the game. By tilting the pillow left and right and up and down once can choose which arrow key they would like to press. To press on a key, the user has to squeeze the pillow (give it a good hug!). When you release the pillow the arrow key is released.
